        Initialize Ocean class.

        This class provides the main top-level functions in ocean protocol:
         * Publish assets metadata and associated services
            * Each asset is assigned a unique DID and a DID Document (DDO)
            * The DDO contains the asset's services including the metadata
            * The DID is registered on-chain with a URL of the metadata store
              to retrieve the DDO from
         * Discover/Search assets via the current configured metadata store
         * Purchase asset services by choosing a service agreement from the
           asset's DDO. Purchase goes through the service agreements interface
           and starts by signing a service agreement then sending the signature
           to the publisher's Brizo via the `purchaseEndpoint` in the service
           definition:
